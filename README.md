# downloading Vagrant 
# also considering using jupyter-notebook to serve a python code interpreter which will have the fizzbuzz test easy to run
# vagarant will have to port forward jupyter-notebook to host port so that notebook can be accessed
# wrote fizzbuzz in python using ipython notebook interpreter locally
# def fizzbuzz():
#    for i in range(1,101):  
#        if i%3==0 and i%5==0:
#            print "fizubuzz"
#        elif i%3==0:
#            print "fizz"
#        elif i%5==0:
#            print "buzz"
#        else:
#            print str(i)
#
# checked results of fizzbuzz to reasonable depth
